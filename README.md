# Description
The project is about publishing the RAW camera images and calibration information of the camera on Differnet ROS Topics which can be further fed into any Image processing pipeline.

**Note:** The provided code only works for the camera **IDS U3 cameras** (I have used IDS U3-3260CP-C-HQ Model)

### Hardware used:
1. IDS U3-3260CP-C-HQ Model

### Softwares:
1. IDS Peak Cockpit (This should be downloaded from the IDS Website)
2. IDS Software suite (This should be downloaded from the IDS Website)
3. OS used - **Ubuntu 20.04**
4. ROS DISTRO - **ROS Noetic**

### Prerequisites:
The camera being used is assumed to be calibrated. If not you can use the same package to publish the RAW images and then use [this existing ROS package](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration).

If you are unable to run this without yaml file, Try copying this content and place it in the **right_cam_info.yaml** file and place it in **/src/config/** folder.

once the calibration is completed, copy the **YAML** file that has been generated and then replace the existing file present at **/src/config/** folder, Since this is the original param file.
or You can simply replace the contents of the existing YAML file with the actual calibration results generated by using [this existing ROS package](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration).

### How to use this Package ?

In one terminal 

Run 
> roslaunch ids_ros camera_launch.launch

This will publish the RAW Camera images and Camera calibration information.

you can use this information to perform further image processing like Distortion correction or any other Image Processing
